Research Fellow                      Marine Instrumentation & Computer Division 
1. Led software development and hardware design on India’s ﬁrst Autonomous 
   Underwater Vehicle (MAYA)
+ Wrote over 95% of Control, Communications, Recovery, Guidance and  Navigation 
  code
+ Required Control Systems, Robotics, Computer Networking
+ Coded in C++ (Linux), Visual C++ (Windows) for Control GUI, C 
  (for micro controllers) and Matlab for prototyping
+ Designed most of the original embedded circuitry for CAN actuator nodes

2. Developed a Wave-recorder that uploaded wave-data to server via GSM cellular 
   data-modems
+ One of the earliest GSM-enabled instruments in Oceanography
+ Code written in C (Embedded), Visual C++ for Windows-based GUI
+ Hardware design involved PCB layout software (Eagle)

National Institute of Oceanography, Goa, India        August 2002 - August 2003
Project Assistant                    Marine Instrumentation & Computer Division 
1. Worked on the design of a heading controller for ROSS - ”Remotely Operated 
   Sea Skimmer”, a surface craft which was remotely controlled
+ Tested robot at sea successfully at sea (soldered broken circuitry at sea)
+ Code written in C/C++ (Linux), Visual C++ for Windows-based GUI
+ Hardware design involved PCB layout software (Eagle)

2. Developed Tide-gauges for the Indo-Ghanaian Collaborative program  (UNESCO)
+ Tide gauges I developed are still functional after 8 years without servicing
+ Code written in C/C++ (Embedded), Visual C++ for Windows-based GUI



ENTREPRENEURIAL EXPERIENCE
1. KnoVid - Developing an alternate unobtrusive Interest-based ad system for 
   Android and iOS devices
